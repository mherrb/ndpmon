1. Requirements
----------------

NDPMon is written in C, which is why you need a C compiler. During the 
implementation, we used GCC version 4.7

Besides the classic system libraries, other additional libraries are 
required:
    * build-essentials
    * libtool 
    * autoconf 
    * automake 
    * autotools-dev
    * libxml2-dev
    * libpcap-dev
    * bsd-mailx

And for some uses also:
    * libxslt1-dev
    * libssl-dev
    * libnetfilter-queue-dev
    * wireshark
    * a web server e.g. apache2

Make sure you have these libraries and the associated headers installed.

In addition to that, NDPMon needs a "mail" program installed to send mail
notifications, e.g. bsd-mailx in the dependencies list.

2. Configuring NDPMon
---------------------

If you have troubles with the configure script, regenerate it with the 
command:

autoreconf -vi

To configure NDPMon with a very basic set of features use:

    ./configure

Use the following options to enable additional features:

    --enable-mac-resolv
        Resolve the manufacturers of MAC addresses.
    --enable-countermeasures
        Respond to certain attacks.
    --enable-syslogfilter
        Save syslog messages to /var/log/ndpmon.lo
    --enable-lnfq
        Use libnetfilter_queue instead of PCAP.
        This requires libnetfilter-queue-dev, libnfnetlink and ip6tables to be
        installed.
        Do not forget to add a netfilter rule like
            ip6tables -t raw -A PREROUTING -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 0
        to enable NDPMon to recieve packets.
    --enable-webinterface
        Store station and alert overviews as HTML files in a specified
        webserver htdocs directory.
        This requires a running webserver on localhost, e.g. apache2.
        Use the variable WEBDIR to change the path to the htdocs
        directory.

3. Building and installing NDPMon
---------------------------------

To compile and install NDPMon, simply use the command:

    make && make install

To uninstall it, use:

    make uninstall

Note that the install and uninstall targets require root privileges.

Other interesting makefile targets are:

    make clean4svn
        Extended cleanup of the source code files. You may use this feature
        in association with autoconf to restore the original configure script
        and start the build process from scratch.
    make doc_generate
        Generates the HTML source code documentation. Requires doxygen to be
        installed.
    make doc_clean
        Removes the HTML source code documenation, if any is present.

4. Running NDPMon
-----------------

Before running NDPMon, make sure to edit the configuration file
/usr/local/ndpmon/config_ndpmon.xml to adapt it to your network.

To run NDPMon, use as root:

/etc/init.d/ndpmon start

To stop NDPMon, use as root:

/etc/init.d/ndpmon stop
